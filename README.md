## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I set up conditions for my gifts?

Conditions are added to gift categories (Products -> Gift categories). There you can add new gift categories or edit any existing one. Just click the category to open it in a new editing screen, and add/edit/remove any possible combination of conditions for your gifts. When you have your gift categories ready, you can assign any giftable product to that gift category.

### How do I assign a gift category to a gift?

On the 'Product data' meta box in the product editing screen, you can mark any existing WooCommerce product as 'Giftable', or add new products and select 'Gift' as product type. You will then see a new product options tab called 'Gift options', where you can select and assign Gift categories for a gift or a giftable product.

### Can I hide product tabs for gifts?

There is a 'Show tabs' options for each gift on the Edit product screen 'Gift option' tab, and it's disabled by default.

### Can I change the gift box and buttons titles? 

Yes. You can do that on the Gifts settings tab (WooCommerce -> Settings -> Gifts).
